# in the con.py-module (connections) the different types of possible connections (gsm, wlan) are defined

# in the gps.py-module the communication with the gps-module is defined

# in the par.py-module (parse) the handling of data-string is defined either the client- or the server-way

# in the talk.py-module the sending/recieving takes place

# first, the gpsdeamon should decide, if it's the client or the server.
